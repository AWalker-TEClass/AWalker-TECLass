### Hi there 👋

<!--
**AWalker-TEClass/AWalker-TEClass** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on getting comfortable with syntax
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, hopefully some Java, and looking forward to CSS
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... actually... nothing at the moment?  That'll probably change in a week.  
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with breaking down and understanding what all goes into a video game, so I can tear them apart and make some interesting mods.  
- 💬 Ask me about my cats.  
- 📫 How to reach me: Good luck.  Best place is Discord, and that's spotty at best.  If you need to reach me immediately, send me an Email to abonnett1@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I ride a motorcycle, and I'm working on my pilot's liscense.
